# Library Management System

This project is a Library Management System designed to manage books, members, and authors. The system is represented using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the relationships between entities.

## Features
- Manage books, authors, and members.
- Track member borrowing activities in load entity.
- Record book loans borrow and returns date.


## ERD Overview
The ERD includes the following entities:
- **Books**: Represents the collection of books in the library.
- **Authors**: Details about book authors.
- **Members**: Information about library members.
- **loans**: Records of book borrow and return activities and who borrowd it.

## Future Steps: Converting ERD to Relational Tables
To implement this system in a database, follow these steps:
1. **Define Tables**: Convert each entity in the ERD into a relational table.
2. **Establish Relationships**: Use foreign keys to represent relationships between tables.
3. **Normalize Data**: Ensure the database design adheres to normalization principles to avoid redundancy.
4. **Implement Constraints**: Add primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints to maintain data integrity.
5. **Test the Schema**: Populate the tables with sample data and test queries to ensure the schema works as expected.
